# SMART-AGRICULTURE-USING-IOT-AND-MACHINE-LEARNING

Agriculture balances both food requirement for mankind and supplies indispensable raw materials for many industries, and it is the most significant and fundamental occupationin India. The advancement in inventive farming techniques is gradually enhancing the crop yield making it more profitable and reduce irrigation wastages. The proposed model is a smart irrigation system which predicts the water requirement for a crop, using machine learning algorithm. Moisture, temperature and humidity are the three most essential parameters to determine the quantity of water required in any agriculture field. This system comprises of temperature, humidity and moisture sensor, deployed in an agricultural field, sends data through a microprocessor, developing an IoT device with cloud. Machine learning algorithms is applied on the data sensed from the field in to predict results efficiently, which helps in decision making regarding water supply in advance.
